# Statecraft

In Statecraft, the fate of your nation lies in your hands. Will you be proud of your work?

## To Fix

* change header on start page
* change class names
* clean up data/props in classes (import once, then send down component tree)
* clean up CSS
* make it more responsive


## Improvement Goals

* add "pick a national anthem" to initial screen
* add Travis as a component in the lower right, who returns a response and acts like Clippy from old Microsoft Word
  * 'You did not pass Travis!'
* we need more questions and results.
* make it possible to play again, either by having different players/accounts or by reseting the game back to nil
* add dynamic content to question and answer texts
* add response component to display response text during survey. response text has been added to the first question in question api for reference of where it should go.
* calculate approval at the end instead as a derived value?
