# Statecraft

In Statecraft, the fate of your nation lies in your hands. Will you be proud of your work?

## To Fix

* fix positioning on results page
* change header on start page
* change class names
* clean up data/props in classes (import once, then send down component tree)
* clean up CSS
* make it more responsive

## Improvement Goals

* we need more questions and results.
* make it possible to play again, either by having different players/accounts or by reseting the game back to nil
* add dynamic content to question and answer texts
* add response component to display response text during survey. response text has been added to the first question in question api for reference of where it should go.
* calculate approval at the end instead as a derived value?
